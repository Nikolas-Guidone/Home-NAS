# Network Attached Storage

## Overview

My personal Network Attached Storage project aimed to not only provide hands-on experience for networking, CLI, etc. but was a valuable opportunity for me to explore how setting up servers work, as well as maintaining, updating, protecting, and running various apps and jobs simultaneously on my home network.

### Skills Learned

- Practiced understanding of physical networking.
- Configuring network interfaces with static IP's to ensure reachability.
- Configuring manual DNS to route all network traffic to correct end destination.
- Monitoring all inbound and outbound network traffic with various tools such as Wireshark.
- Practiced access control and permissions to ensure applications and users had access to only what is needed.
- Configuring RAID backups for redundency
- Read and analyze logs to understand issues
- Learned the basics of dockers and containers to run and deploy applications
